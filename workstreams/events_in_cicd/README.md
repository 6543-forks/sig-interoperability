# Events in CI/CD Readme

This is a workstream within the CDF SIG Interoperability.

The forming of this workstream was suggested on a [recent SIG Interoperability meeting]( https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-interoperability/blob/master/docs/meetings.md#may-28-2020) and its first meeting was held on June 8th.

## Scope
Discuss all about what events should be used for in a CI/CD process

## Mission
Standardize events to be used in a CD process

## What is an event?
To be defined. Event vs. Message vs. Notification
Proposal:
* Things that happen/occur in a CD process.
* Notifications that are sent out due to things that happen/occur in a CD process.
* Message = Routable
* Event has no recipient
* Event is decoupled from consumers

## Members
Current members:
* Ravi Lachhman, Harness
* Andreas Grimmer, Dynatrace
* Emil BÃ¤ckmark, Ericsson
* Ramin Akhbari, eBay

Membership to this workstream is open to public and self-declared.

* Join the [#events-in-cicd channel on CDF Slack](https://cdeliveryfdn.slack.com/archives/C0151BTKEJX) and introduce yourself.
