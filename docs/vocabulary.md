## Introduction

There are many ways to greet someone and as humans if we do not understand the
word being used we have the ability to observe body language, process tone,
and even touch. These many different natural inputs allow us as humans to
establish shared vocabulary upon which we have been able to build successful
components relevant to our way of living and social norms of interacting.

Unfortunately for machines, this process is not so easy as we humans have to
decide if we want to establish norms which we often surface when talking about
machine interactions as protocols and best practices or requirements.

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD)  practitioners have
many tools at their disposal but it is often the case that what we call a
pipeline in todayâ€™s tool of choice is not called the same thing in the tool we
use tomorrow. Again, we can within our sphere of influence and interaction
adjust for these nuances but machines talking to one another do not have that
same luxury necessarily.

The purpose of this document is to collect the basic terms used by CI/CD tools
and technologies in order to work on establishing a shared vocabulary for us
humans to communicate and collaborate better.

## Terminology Used by CI/CD Tools and Technologies

This section contains list of some key terms used by various CI/CD tools and
technologies.

### ArgoCD

[ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/) is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.

Some of the core ArgoCD concept are listed below: [[16]]

- **Application**: A group of Kubernetes resources as defined by a manifest. This is a Custom Resource Definition (CRD).
- **Application controller** [[19]]: Kubernetes controller which continuously monitors running applications and compares live vs. desired state.
- **Application source type**: Which tool is used to build the application.
- **Target state**: The desired state of an application, as represented by files in a Git repository.
- **Live state**: The live state of that application. What pods etc are deployed.
- **Sync status**: Whether or not the live state matches the target state. Is the deployed application the same as Git says it should be?
- **Sync**: The process of making an application move to its target state. E.g. by applying changes to a Kubernetes cluster.
- **Sync operation status**: Whether or not a sync succeeded.
- **Refresh**: Compare the latest code in Git with the live state. Figure out what is different.
- **Health**: The health of the application, is it running correctly? Can it serve requests?
- **Tool**: A tool to create manifests from a directory of files. E.g. Kustomize or Ksonnet. See Application Source Type.
- **Configuration management tool**: See tool.
- **Configuration management plugin**: A custom tool.
- **Project** [[17]]: A logical grouping of applications. They enable control over deployment permissions based on source, target and kind, among other criteria.
- **Sync phases** [[18]]: Pre-sync, sync and post-sync allow for controlled orchestrated execution of sync operations.
- **Sync waves**: Within any one sync phase, an additional control of sequential execution is accomplished using waves, to ensure certain resources are healthy before subsequent resources are synced.

### CircleCI

[CircleCI](https://circleci.com) allows teams to rapidly build quality
projects, at scale.

Some of the core CircleCI terms are listed below. [[1]]

- **Step**: A step is a collection of executable commands.

jobs and their run order. (used interchangeably with pipeline)
- **Pipeline**: A pipeline is an object that you may configure and run on
the CircleCI platform.
- **Executor**: Defines the underlying technology to run a job.

### Codefresh

[Codefresh](https://codefresh.io/) is a modern CI/CD platform with native Docker, Kubernetes and Helm support that allows you to easily build, integrate, and deploy your product.

Some of the core Codefresh concepts are listed below: [[20]]

- **Projects**: The top-level concept in Codefresh. You can create projects to group pipelines that are related. In most cases a single project will be a single application (that itself contains many micro-services).
- **Pipelines**: Each project can have multiple pipelines. Pipelines that belong to a single project are easily managed all together. 
- **Pipeline Steps**: Each pipeline has a definition that defines the pipeline steps that are executed each time this pipeline is triggered. The definition of a pipeline is described in a special codefresh.yml file. 
- **Triggers**: Each pipeline can have zero, one, or more triggers. Triggers are the linking medium between a pipeline and a git repository. Codefresh supports several kinds of triggers such as Git, Cron or Docker push triggers. 

### Eiffel

[Eiffel](https://eiffel-community.github.io/) is a technology agnostic CI/CD event protocol. The events and their parameters are generic enough to cover any kind of CI/CD engine/framework and SCMs.

Some of the terms used in Eiffel events are listed below. [[14]]

- **Activity**: An activity is any kind of action in a CI/CD system, normally triggered by an operation done in an SCM system or by a previous activity. Activities are hierarchical. Activities could be whole pipelines, pipeline steps or any level of pipeline sub steps.
- **Event**: An Eiffel event is a broadcast notification telling any consumer about an event occurring in the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Artifact**: Artifacts are items or software packages generated in a CI/CD pipeline, for example a built binary or a Docker image. An artifact should be possible to identify using a purl ([package URL](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec)). An artifact is often the subject of a test executed or a delivery performed within a CI/CD pipeline.
- **Environment**: An Eiffel environment defines the environment in which an activity is executed. Could be for example a host, node, service name/uri, a Docker image or some other kind of machine configuration definition.
- **Source Change**: A source change is the unit of a review. It results in a single commit when merged to the Git repository.
- **Submit**: A submit is the action of merging a source change to its intended target branch.
- *Pipeline*: A pipeline is not a term defined by Eiffel, but it is used in the Eiffel protocol documentation when explaining how Eiffel events can be combined to form a chain of activities often triggered by a source change being created or submitted.
- *Step*: A step is not a term defined by Eiffel, but it is used in the Eiffel protocol documentation to exemplify activities executed in a pipeline.

## Mapping of Terms

The Tools and Technologies listed in this document use more or less same
terminology for naming things with few differences, workflow vs pipeline or
runner vs node except the smaller units of work.

Fields marked as *N/A* in the tables below means that the author of this
document failed to identify corresponding term in the documentation of those
tools and does not mean those units of work are not supported by the tools.
Fields containing a question mark is the author's guess and might be incorrect.

### CI/CD Tools and Technologies

The table below is an attempt to create a mapping of different terms used
by CI/CD Tools and Technologies and could contain errors. The main term used
while creating the table is **pipeline** since almost all the tools listed in
this document use the word pipeline to describe pretty similar things. Smaller
units of terms then mapped based on how they are described in relation to
pipeline in corresponding documentation.

### Pipeline Step Types

The table below is an attempt to create a mapping of common names for the various types of build Steps (the unit of work two degrees smaller than a build pipeline). (The effort of proposing a common vocabulary across CI/CD Tools and Technologies is not yet performed, but we'll use the most common term from the table above as the working term.)

While CI/CD tools and technologies generally give developers broad leeway in naming and implementing their pipeline steps, agreeing upon some common terms will help develop more pluggable pipelines. This list is not meant to be exhaustive.

Each type of step will generally have several implementations that are tool specific. For example, Source will have implementations for various Source Code Management (SCM) tools. Publish will have implementations for each type of repository, and so on.
