## Introduction

There are many ways to greet someone and as humans if we do not understand the
word being used we have the ability to observe body language, process tone,
and even touch. These many different natural inputs allow us as humans to
establish shared vocabulary upon which we have been able to build successful
components relevant to our way of living and social norms of interacting.

Unfortunately for machines, this process is not so easy as we humans have to
decide if we want to establish norms which we often surface when talking about
machine interactions as protocols and best practices or requirements.

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD)  practitioners have
many tools at their disposal but it is often the case that what we call a
pipeline in todayâ€™s tool of choice is not called the same thing in the tool we
use tomorrow. Again, we can within our sphere of influence and interaction
adjust for these nuances but machines talking to one another do not have that
same luxury necessarily.

The purpose of this document is to collect the basic terms used by CI/CD tools
and technologies in order to work on establishing a shared vocabulary for us
humans to communicate and collaborate better.

## Terminology Used by CI/CD Tools and Technologies

This section contains list of some key terms used by various CI/CD tools and
technologies.

third-party application or integration needed.

Some of the core GitLab CI/CD terms are listed below. [[3]]

- **Job**: Instructions that a runner has to execute.
- **Stage**: Elements to group and run jobs in certain way - jobs in same
stage are run in parallel and jobs in next stage run after the jobs from the
previous stage completed successfully.
- **Pipeline**: A collection of jobs split into different stages.
- **Runner**: An agent or server that executes each job individually that can
spin up or down as needed.
- **Trigger**: Trigger allows you to define downstream pipeline trigger.

- **Job**: A user-configured description of work which Jenkins should
perform, such as building a piece of software, etc.
- **Project**: A deprecated term, synonymous with Job.

their software delivery at any scale.

Some of the core Jenkins X terms are listed below. [[5]]

- **Step**: Basic building block to execute one or more commands.
- **Stage**: Collection of steps and the required configuration.

for Continuous Delivery.

Some of the core Screwdriver terms are listed below. [[6]]

- **Step**: List of commands to execute.
- **Job**: Collection of the steps to run.

delivery platform for releasing software changes with high velocity and
confidence.

Some of the core Spinnaker terms are listed below. [[7]]

- **Task**: An atomic function to perform.
- **Stage**: A collection of sequential Tasks and composed Stages that describe
a higher-level action the Pipeline will perform either linearly or in parallel.
- **Pipeline**: The pipeline is the key deployment management construct in
Spinnaker. It consists of a sequence of actions, known as stages.
- **Pipeline Template**: A parameterized pipeline, minus the pipeline
configuration found on a pipeline instance. This template helps developers
create pipelines that follow a pattern that you establish.
- **Pipeline configuration**: The same as the configuration for a pipeline
not created from a template, plus variable bindings and a reference to the
template.
- **Cluster**: Logical groupings of Server Groups in Spinnaker.
- **Provider**: A Cloud Provider is an interface to a set of virtual resources
that Spinnaker has control over.
- **Trigger**: A pipeline trigger defines when to automatically run a pipeline.

### Tekton

[The Tekton Pipelines](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline) project provides
k8s-style resources for declaring CI/CD-style pipelines.

Some of the core Tekton terms are listed below. [[8]]

- **Step**: a specific function to perform.
- **Task**: is a collection of sequential steps you would want to run as part
of your continuous integration flow. A task will run inside a pod on your cluster.
- **ClusterTask**: Similar to Task, but with a cluster scope.
- **Pipeline**: stateless, reusable, parameterized collection of tasks. Tasks are
linked together in a Pipeline, which describes the end-to-end deployment for an application.
- **PipelineRun**: an instantiation of a Pipeline definition, filling in the 
Pipeline's parameters with concrete values

enqueued into a pipeline.
- **Node**: Virtual or static machines where the jobs are scheduled on.
- **Executor**: Executors are responsible for running jobs.

merge one branch into another.
- **Review**: Process that enables peer-review to improve the quality of
code.
- **Merge Check**: Checks to ensure MR can be merged without issues.
- **Merge**: Acceptance of a MR by the maintainers.

## Mapping of Terms

The CI/CD Tools and Technologies listed in this document use more or less
same terminology for naming things with few differences, workflow vs pipeline
or runner vs node except the smaller units of work.

The table below is an attempt to create a mapping of different terms used
by CI/CD Tools and Technologies and could contain errors. The main term used
while creating the table is **pipeline** since almost all the tools listed in
this document use the word pipeline to describe pretty similar things. Smaller
units of terms then mapped based on how they are described in relation to pipeline
in corresponding documentation.

| Project            |        |         |         |          |         |              |
|--------------------|--------|---------|---------|----------|---------|--------------|
| **CircleCI**       | N/A    | Step    | Job     | Workflow | Trigger | Executor     |
| **GitHub Actions** | Action | Step    | Job     | Workflow | Event   | Runner       |
| **GitLab CI/CD**   | N/A    | Job     | Stage   | Pipeline | Trigger | Runner       |
| **Jenkins**        | N/A    | Job     | Stage   | Pipeline | Trigger | Agent/Node   |
| **Jenkins X**      | N/A    | Step    | Stage   | Pipeline | Trigger | Agent        |
| **Screwdriver**    | N/A    | Step    | Job     | Pipeline | Trigger | N/A          |
| **Spinnaker**      | N/A    | Task    | Stage   | Pipeline | Trigger | Cluster      |
| **Tekton**         | N/A    | Step    | Task    | Pipeline | Trigger | Resource (?) |
| **Zuul**           | N/A    | N/A     | Job     | Pipeline | Trigger | Node (?)     |

Fields marked as *N/A* means that the author of this document failed to identify
corresponding term in the documentation of those tools and does not mean those units
of work are not supported by the tools. (this could be the case...)

Fields contain question mark is the author's guess and might be incorrect.
