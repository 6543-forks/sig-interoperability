        * The Contributor Summits are focused on CDF projects: https://cd.foundation/projects/

* SIG Interoperability Co-chair nominations/elections, Fatih Degirmenci, All
* New work around terminology for pipeline [stages](https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-interoperability/pull/76) and [steps](https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-interoperability/pull/81) - see links to PRs. Ann Marie Fred

        * Artifact Handling
        * Policy Driven CD
    * CDEvents 
    * Would be interesting to outline or create a catalogue of quality gates. 
        * Gather a list of what quality gates companies and teams are using in the wild. 
            * Mini case studies for different quality gates would be interesting.
            * How to gather: Survey? Shoutout on channels? See action items below.
            * Relates to best practices
            * Also, would be interesting to consider how to evaluate pipelines (not testing the actual pipeline or security concerns, necessarily), but really what should a pipeline contain. Again, very much a best practices question.
            * What signals do we use for quality?
                * execution speed of pipelines, etc
                * How many quality checks, ideal range
                * how do the quality checks bucket -- interesting to see if this becomes evident once catalogue created (eg, gates in place pre and post production/rollout)
* \<addme\>

#### Action Items
* [Justin Abrahms to create discussion on Interop SIG repo on what quality gates on being used by teams.](https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-interoperability/discussions/83)
* Kara to make sure CDF publicizes the discussion.
* Kara to bring in others, from Styra, etc, to discuss how they see quality gates being used in practice.
